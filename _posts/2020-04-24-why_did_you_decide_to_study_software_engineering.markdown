After I graduated with a B.S. of Computer Science I had interests in a variety of fields. I initially thought that my career path was a calling towards game development, and so I took multiple courses in game design and development as an undergrad, but as I tried my hand at it there wasn't as much passion as I thought there would be. I also had a keen fascination with data science and machine learning, and I absolutely loved taking an Artificial Intelligence class during my senior year as an undergrad. I attempted to self-teach myself to be industry-grade proficient in data science soon after graduation, but I found that I wasn't making as much progress as I wanted to in order to become fully knowledgable and ready for a job in that field quite yet. Perhaps if the future holds that in store for me. I then switched over to teaching myself web development in Java with Spring/Hibernate, but after a few months of that I didn't find enjoyment in developing with Spring/Hibernate. Frantic, I tried my hand at learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and eventually found out about React. After self-teaching that for a month or two, I hopped onboard with another partner to redesign a client's website entirely in React and I fell in love with the development process. I knew that I wanted to become a full-stack developer, and won't stop working at it until my dream is complete.
