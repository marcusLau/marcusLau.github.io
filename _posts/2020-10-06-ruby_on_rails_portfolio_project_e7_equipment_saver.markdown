I decided to develop something useful for myself and my friends for this Ruby on Rails project. I created an application that would allow my friends and I to more easily view our character's equipments for a RPG game called Epic Seven in one centralized location. The application was enjoyable to develop and plan from square one. I hope to continue developing this application and to publish it to the community once I have polished up a few more features, but for now it is a good start.

Planning this project took a few days as I wanted to make sure the design made sense before tackling it. I refactored my models and associations multiple times, but ended up with the models: User, Gear, and Comments. An user can have many gears, and gears can have many comments through users. 

The next step after planning my models was to design my user stories. I wanted to have an user story for every interaction an user could have with my application to make sure I cover all my bases and have a nice, streamlined process of development.

Once my user stories were created, the developing process was straight-forward minus a few bugs that I ran into. All in all, I'm very happy with how my portfolio project turned out, and I am looking forward to continuing to develop this application to release to the community.
