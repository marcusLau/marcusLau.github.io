For my first portfolio project we were tasked with creating a CLI Data Gem Project that gathers data from an external source such as an API or through web scraping. I initially had brainstormed a couple of ideas such as a gym product web scraper which would be helpful since I was in the process of building a home gym, but with the #BlackLivesMatter movement recently circulating I decided that it would be better to attempt to challenge myself to create a CLI that would benefit people in learning more about the various foundations supporting the movement. 

While planning out my CLI, I first designed how I wanted my features to look like in the CLI in a text editor. I designed how I wanted my objects to behave and what variables my objects would hold from the scraped data. I went with a mindset of "writing code that I wished I had" which helped me a lot in planning my developmental direction. An example of this would be me coding how I wanted to display my scraped data from my Foundation objects before I had even scraped the data. This mindset allowed me to keep my thinking clear as I tried new approaches or ideas in development. 

The hardest obstacle for me was learning how to scrape specific data from a variety of websites. Because of the concept of this project, I have to make 5 separate web scrapers for 5 different foundation websites, and the bulk of my time developing was spent getting up to speed with Nokogiri and CSS selectors. After two days of practice, web scraping became much easier and I was able to scrape the rest of the needed data in one day. 

This project was a fun project to brainstorm, design, and develop, and I feel proud to have overcome all obstacles throughout this project on my own. To bigger and better things.
